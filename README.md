## Jacques Cousteau Exploration Profile Landing Page

This project features a functional landing page grid layout inspired by the legendary ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau. The grid layout includes cards with location titles and a like button for each location.

### Page Features
- Grid layout for cards
- Location titles and like button for each card
- Add button with 60% opacity on hover
- Edit button with 60% opacity on hover
- Smooth layout using grid and flexbox at smaller resolutions

### Why Grid and Flexbox
I chose to use grid and flexbox for this project because they provide a flexible and responsive layout that adapts well to different screen sizes. The grid layout allows for easy organization and alignment of the cards, while flexbox helps with spacing and alignment of the content within each card.
